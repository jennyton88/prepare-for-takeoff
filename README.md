# Prepare for Takeoff! - Model for the 3d Modelling Jam With Blender

Check out the submission page on [itch](https://jennydevs.itch.io/prepare-for-takeoff) and view the turnaround on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbK8Gei-Dg).

## Final Image Render

## Thoughts & Notes

- Painting was done all in Blender
- Render is 1920 x 1080
- Emission material works well for removing faces and nice flat colors (but unshaded)
- Subdivided the creatures for a smoother effect, I hope I can create a feeling of roundness without using subdivision in later projects
- I like how I painted the dock, especially the ends of them, although I should have added shadow below the dock to make it more realistic and match with the ground texture
- I wanted to add buildings to the background and a sign...
- I knew that I wanted the final result to be viewed as a turnaround, but making a GIF under the itch file size limits was impossible at this time without compromising on quality, so I posted it on YouTube
- I modeled the serpent without taking into account the angle needed to view everyone at once without one blocking the other, should have matched my drawing more
- I expected to have a turnaround at face level, but that wouldn't have worked out
- The wings should have had transparent feather edges, but I liked the look here so I kept it
- The clouds have a transparent texture, but they were really a mask, should continue to learn more about it

It would be cool to try modeling this again in a few months.
